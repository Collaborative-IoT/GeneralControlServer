/*
Handles all functionality that has to be carried out by communication and
handles repetitive pre-checks.

For example:
    before a user makes a request to join a room, are they banned?
    before a user makes a request to add a speaker, is the speaker in the room?

Small checks like this are pre-checks that usually are no brainers and
aren't included in the core logic of different modules.
